<LI>You create your windows in a resource file. (Sometimes you only need
   to design views, not windows, this is also possible. Just drag a BView
   into the resources, open it for editing and add other views to it.)
   <br>Name the window resource (e.g. <B>"About Window"</B>)<P>
<LI>Save your resource file and select '<B>Generate Sources</B>' from the file
   menu.
   For the first time it will create <B>AboutWindow.cpp</B>, <B>AboutWindow.h</B> and
   <B>AboutWindowDefs.h</B>. The former two are just almost empty class 
   declarations with some methods filled in according to the views 
   (e.g. MessageReceived).
   These 2 files will not be overwritten later, so you can modify them.<BR>
   <B>AboutWindowDefs.h</B> will always be generated when you select '<B>Generate 
   Sources</B>' and contains the view names and message constants. Don't
   modify this file.<p>
<LI>Add the resource file and the window sources to the project.
   You also need to add a static library (<B>IE.a</B>) which you find in the 
   "Develop/IE library" directory. This library has the full source 
   code there which you may want to examine. <B>IE.a</B> contains the IEWindow
   class which is capable of instantiating a window by name from the
   resources. Alternatively you can add the 3 classes (IEApplication, IEResourceHandler, IEWindow) to your project.<p>
<LI>You decide whether you want your application object derived from 
   <B>IEApplication</B> or <B>BApplication</B>. If you choose the latter, you should
   insert the same functionality to your application class as in
   <B>IEApplication</B>. The only task of <B>IEApplication</B> is to initialize a
   global resource handler. Please see <B>IEApplication.cpp</B> for details.<p>
<LI>In any way you must insert this line to one of your source files 
   (preferably in the application class implementation):<PRE>	IEResourceHandler *resourcehandler;
