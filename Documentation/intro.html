<p><b>Interface Elements</b> is a resource and GUI editor for the <FONT COLOR="#0000ff">B</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">e</FONT>OS with add-on and drag&drop support.<br>
<br>With <b>Interface Elements</b> you can create and edit any objects or datatypes which you have editor
for. The object model that <b>Interface Elements</b> uses allows handling all kinds of objects and datatypes
 the same way.
<p>
You can edit windows and views visually with the built-in <B>view editor</B> with great comfort. There are many operations
available for view editing including undo/cut/copy/paste/duplicate/hide/show/center/stretch/snap/sort/align and several methods
for selecting them. Help is also there. The view editors (which let you edit all properties of a view) follow the <B>class hierarchy</B>, that is when you open a view
(e.g. BButton) you will see the editors of its base classes (BControl, BView). This also means that when you create
a new view add-on, you don't have to make editors for the base classes. When editing a window or a view, a
<B>detailed view hierarchy</B> is shown with all the child view names and classes.
<p>
The window and view editors create and edit standard <FONT COLOR="#0000ff">B</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">e</FONT>OS window and view archives.
<p>
Some objects (e.g. BWindow) are able to <B>generate C++ source</B> with methods, as well as the definitions and message constants which they use.
<p>
There are 23 interface add-ons (window and views) and 3 other add-ons included with the program:
<UL>
	<LI><B>BBox, BButton, BCheckBox, BColorControl, BControl, BListView, BMenu, BMenuBar, BMenuField, 
		BMenuItem, BOutlineListView, BPictureButton, BRadioButton, BScrollBar, BScrollView, BSlider, BStatusBar, BTabView, BTextControl, BTextView
		BView, BWindow</B>
	<LI><B>data, long, string</B>
</UL>
<p>
The add-on API is simple and well documented so anyone with a little programming experience can create his own 
datatype or view add-on. Sample add-on sources are included.
<p>The program contains a <B>visual clipboard</B> and a <B>message target</B> to help software developing even more.
<p><b>Interface Elements is an essential tool for a  <FONT COLOR="#0000ff">B</FONT><FONT COLOR="#ff0000">e</FONT>OS developer</b>.
