<h2>Known bugs and limitations</h2>

<p>Please send me bug reports if you find one. I reported all BeOS bugs to Be, Inc. Fortunately the number of Interface Elements and BeOS bugs are decreasing.
<UL>
<p><LI>BOutlineListView still doesn't instantiate its selection message correctly. I don't
	recommend specifying a selection/invocation message until this is fixed in the BeOS.
<p><LI>You still can't drop replicants to the editor since only BShelf can accept replicants.
	Never mind.<p><LI>The resource file size on PPC is always increasing when saving regardless how many resources
you delete. This may be a PEF problem since resources are stored as PEF containers on the PPC.

</UL>

<h2>History</h2>

<h3>v1.31 (5 July 1999)</h3>
Recompiled for BeOS R4.5.
<UL>
<p><LI>bug fix: add-ons are found if they are links
</UL>

<h3>v1.3 (6 Jan 1999)</h3>
After several beta versions during the R4 beta period this is a full release with documentation and a sample project.
<UL>
<p><LI>new add-ons: BTabView and BSlider
<p><LI>large part of the view editor was rewritten
<p><LI>view alignment in 6 ways
<p><LI>sorting the children of a views is now possible (top to bottom, left to right)
<p><LI>Shift-Control-Command click is passed to the view instead of the editor (test view)
<p><LI>arrow keys move the selection by one pixel
<p><LI>the always-problematic BScrollView works well
<p><LI>a sample project was included in the Develop directory
</UL>

<h3>v1.1 (3 May 1998)</h3>
<UL>
<p><LI>Window editor contains the new look and feel constants and new flags. The view editor is also updated with the new view flag
<P><LI>The IE library is font sensitive, it has a new method (RescaleArchive), which rescales a view
or window archive based on the UI design font and the current plain font size. RescaleArchive is a contribution of Mathias Agopian.
<p><li>Some bugs were fixed, e.g. BMenuBar doesn't crash if you insert a separator item in it
<p><li>Workaround was inserted for a new R3 BeOS bug: dragging off-screen bitmaps usually didn't work!
<p><li>Last but not least IE was ported to BeOS for Intel
</UL>

<h3>v1.02 (8 Jan 1998)</h3>
<UL>
<p><LI>BPictureButton add-on is included. It works if you have Datatypes installed.
<p><LI>The data sizes in the resource window are drawn smoothly as you resize the window.
<p><LI>Now you can select "Unique ID" for a message constant in a view editor when you edit a view archive
<p><LI>A header file is generated for view archives which contains the message constants for the view and its children
<p><LI>BScrollView works well. Drop any views inside the BScrollView, which you want to have as parent.
<p><LI>When you paste or drop a large or mini icon and you hold down Shift, the icons are inserted as BBitmap archives.
<p><LI>The documentation is updated and contains detailed steps how to work with archived windows
<p><LI>When you save the resource file, the currently edited resources are also saved even if you didn't close their window
<p><LI>Snap now outputs coordinate values which are dividable with the snap value
<p><LI>The way of exporting the add-on symbols is changed to prepare for BeOS on Intel.
<p><LI>BMenuItem editor sometimes couldn't assign unique ID. Fixed.
<p><LI>BMenuBar generated the MenusBeginning with incorrect constant names. Fixed.
<p><LI>IEWindow didn't instantiate the minimum/maximum window sizes. Fixed. This is actually a BeOS bug, that BWindow doesn't instantiate and set the minimum/maximum size.
<p><LI>There were problems with resizing the BMenuField. Fixed.
</UL>


<h3>v1.01 (20 Sept 1997)</h3>
<UL>
<p><LI>Data Editor now saves the resource data as C source if Command key is held down
  before dragging the data icon and dropping on a Tracker window
<p><LI>you can edit the BView colors numerically
<p><LI>"_wspace" is removed from the window archive so that the window is opened
  on the current workspace, and not where it was last edited.
<p><LI>BTextView now updates the text if you close the editor
<p><LI>BMenu editor does ScrollToSelection, does not flicker when item added
<p><LI>BTextView (and the textview of BTextControl) had problems with its TextRect due to a BeOS bug (BTextView does
   not archive/instantiate the IsResizable property). I inserted a workaround: made
  the text rectangle much wider.
<p><LI>BMenuItem editor now handles "Unique ID" correctly
<p><LI>BMenuBar inserts the menu title in the message constant name (e.g. MENU_FILE_OPEN)
   Therefore you may need to update these in your existing sources
<p><LI> in the BView editor the flags popup sometimes marked the wrong item
<p><LI>and some other minor bug fixes
</UL>
